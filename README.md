# Queue managind via DQN agent

Application of DQN algorithm in RL model to queue management. Data used in this project comes from [COVID-2019 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/iamhungundji/covid19-symptoms-checker)  

## Premise

RL models provide a great insight to optimization. We can try to determine "optimal" strategy, by which means agent can maximize or minimize given function.
By constructing an enviroment (state-space) and determining possible actions (action-space) we can create sophisticated constraints to a given task, that can serve a great representation of a field's real-world specifics.
Thus we can find a balance between abstract and real, which gives us opportunity to create ready-to-use agents to solve optimization problems.

## Queue model

Queue consists of patients, which are represented by ![https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?16%5Ctimes%201] vectors
